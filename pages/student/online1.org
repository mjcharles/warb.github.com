* Question
- Why might you need to choose an image with a small file size when putting an image into a webpage?
* CSS
- CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheets'
- These are a modern way of controlling the layout and style of your pages
- CSS commands can be in a file by themselves, or inside an html file.
* What does it look like?
- The next file you edit will use CSS to load a background image.
* Independent task...
A challenge for you.
